## Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms (Stanford University)

### Assignment 1: Multiplication of two integers. Refer to [Details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/exam/srsxO/programming-assignment-1/attempt)

The solution has been written in JavaScript and Ruby, using recursive integer multiplication and Karatsuba's algorithm. 
Jest has been used to test the JavaScript solution.

Jest has been used for testing the JavaScript solution.

Download the following text file:
IntegerArray.txt
This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the i^{th}ith row of the file indicates 
the i^{th}ith entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.
